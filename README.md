My name is Clinton macharia maina,i am 20 yrs old and iam from ruiru.
my current learning goals are for me to learn the lanuguages needed to be a full stack developer, 
and then proceed to master other aspects in networking in order for me to get The Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification.
I have always been curious about the world of hacking and i look forward to get this certification.
I am currently trying to learn both python and c++ in order for me to add them onto the other languages i know i am going to learn in the next three months.
I currently don`t have any projects but i do have some ideas that i want to work on as i learn and improve my programming skills.
